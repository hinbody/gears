This simple program takes 2 numbers as input(a front gear or sprocket, and a
rear gear or freewheel/cog) and computes the gear ratio of them. 

Once the application is started, the user is prompted for a sprocket size. After
that is entered, it prompts the user for a freewheel/cog size. The user then
receives the gear ratio of the 2 combined.
